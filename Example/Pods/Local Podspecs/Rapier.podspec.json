  "description": "This pods purpose is to reduce the boilerplate that comes with using dependency\ninjection. It generates an initializer for constructor/initializer injection\nand class members from a dependencies annotation\n(looks like '//sourcery:dependencies:Prot1,Prot2,...').\nAdditionaly you get a generated AppFactory factory class,\nwhich has a function, that creates an object of a type implementing\nthe given protocol. (For that to work, there must be exactly one type implementing\nthat protocol, whose name does not begin with Mock.)",
