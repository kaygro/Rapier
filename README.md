## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Rapier is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod 'Rapier/AutoIntegrate'
```
This is the 'betteries included' variant. (Doesn't work yet)
If you don't like the default integration, just add

```
pod 'Rapier'
```
to your project, but you need to setup your sourcery integration manually.
